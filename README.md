# BBP formula

Implementation of the [Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) in `C`.

## Project idea

We are [two French students](Contributors.md), in [Lyc√©e Hoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Hoche) (Versailles), and we decided to test our limits. As we love the number pi, we searched for a way to calculate its decimal digits.

Most of the existing algorithms require a powerful computer, with a lot of computational power, or memory.

We do not have that.

So here comes the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula, which makes it possible, to only calculate a specific digit, without computing all of the previous ones.

## Commands

This project uses `make` commands to build and use the project.

As such, the following commands are usable:
* `calculator`: builds the calculator and tests its speed to calculate the first N-th digits;
* `client`: builds the server client;
* `server`: builds the server backend part;
* `clean`: deletes all build files;
* `tarball`: ouputs a tar archive with all the code;
* `format`: formats all `.c` and `.h` files following the Linux conventions;
* `docs`: builds this documentation.

## Project architecture

The project can be cut down in smaller modules. They are all inter-connected, but are built apart to sustain a more maintainable architecture.

### Calculator

This is the implementation of the BBP formula in C. This is where all the _magic_ takes place.

_Usage:_ you call the `pi()` function from `calculator/algorithm/algorithm.c`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "calculator/algorithm.h"

int main() {
    printf("The 1000th digit in base 16 is %ld\n.", pi(1000));
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

**Please note**: the algorithm returns the digit in base **16**. It is the role of the next module to convert it either to a base **16** string, or to the base **10**.

### Converter

Converts the digits between the **16** and **10** bases.

_Usage:_ you call the `convert_digit()` to get the base **16** `char` corresponding to the computed digit with the `pi()` function. You can then build a `char*` string to keep all the digits in base **16**, which will be useful later...
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "converter/converter.h"
#include "calculator/algorithm.h"

int main() {
    unsigned int N = 10;

    // We add 1 to N because there will be the '\0' final character
    char *string = (char*)malloc((N + 1) * sizeof(char));

    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        string[i] = convert_digit(pi(i));
    }
    string[i] = '\0';

    // The string is now usable...

    free(string);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

_Usage:_ you call the `convert()` on the string you obtained the step above.
```c
// ...

int main() {
    // ...

    // We use the string
    char *output = convert(string);

    free(output);
    
    // ...

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Under the hood, `convert()` uses the [GNU MPFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_MPFR) library to get the decimal digits of pi with an arbitrary number of digits.

### Server / Client

The thing is: even though the BBP algorithm as well as the flags passed down to `gcc` are already optimized to an impressive level, the computation of the digits of pi will still take time...

To prevent the use of a supercomputer, the best is to use... multiple computers!

So here comes the point: the server is just the main point of our architecture. Every computer can download the client part, connect it to a server, and the client will send computed digits to the server.

At the end, the server only needs to convert the digits to base **10**, and there we are! We calculated ourselves the decimals of pi!

## Algorithms

Where would we be, without these algorithms?

It is our duty to show the used algorithms, so that everybody can recognize the genius behind the formulas:
* [Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula);
* [Modular exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation);
* [Exponentiation by squaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring).

## Roadmap

In order not to lose our way, and stray from the right path, here is the roadmap that should be followed. It will help keep our minds clear, and we should then be able to take a break from the project, and go back to it, knowing what should be done.

* ~~BBP algorithm~~
* ~~base **16** to base **10** conversion~~
* server
    * ~~socket handling~~
    * API
    * database
* client
* optimizations
    * BBP algorithm
        * faster multiplications
        * faster loops
    * base convertions
    * database with concurrent read/write
    * ~~client with threads~~
